                        <p>is the brainchild of Raushan Sapar and Nina Levent. The project has been in the works since 2014 while we were looking for a space that was in line with our vision. The gallery has finally acquired a ground floor space at 9 North Moore Street and renovated this older traditional Tribeca space into a modern sunlit gallery  that respects the architectural legacy of the neighborhood and retains its original charm. After opening in Tribeca in spring of 2016, Sapar Contemporary has launched the Tribeca Art Night (now an independent project) that brought together  art spaces, art lovers, and creators in this neighborhood four times a year.</p>

                    <p><span>SAPAR Contemporary</span> works with international artists who span three generations and five continents. They engage in global conversations and develop vocabularies that resonate as strongly in Baku, Almaty and Istanbul as they do in New York, Berlin, Paris and Mexico City. Their artistic practices vary from meditative traditional ink painting to writing programming code; what connects them are the artists' capacity for empathy, insight, and imagination, their whimsy and generosity of spirit, as well as the rigor and depth of their studio practice. The gallery program offers a unique lens that is immediate and global, future-oriented and accessible, multi-sensory and immersive. We bring together visual artists and creative minds of other disciplines: scientists, engineers, architects, performers, musicians and perfumers. SAPAR Contemporary also commissions works that are site-specific but infused with sensibilities, materialities and traditions of the artists' backgrounds.</p>

                    <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="3"><span>SAPAR Contemporary</span> has also launched a Neo-Nomad Incubator focused on the emerging art scene and cultural traditions of Central Asia. The Incubator program is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The first edition of the Neo Nomad Incubator evolved around the notion of traditional and digital nomadism and aesthetics connected to nomadic experiences. The project explored the relationship between traditional nomadic cultures of Central Asia and Middle East, and realities of migration, globalization and hyper mobility. Current incubator efforts are  going towards unique art trends emerging in Central Asia, South East Russia and Mongolia.  SAPAR Contemporary artists' works have been featured in international Biennials and are included in private and public collections around the world; among them are the MoMA, LACMA, Art Institute of Chicago, Guggenheim, M+,  and many others.
