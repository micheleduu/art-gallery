                        neo nomad project consists of series of multi-media exhibitions, screenings, and 
                        presentations that evolve around the notion of traditional and digital nomadism and 
                        aesthetics connected to nomadic experiences. The project explores the relationship between 
                        traditional nomadic cultures of Central Asia and Middle East, as well as other geographies 
                        in terms of conditions and realities of migration, globalization and hyper mobility.
                        
                        NEO nomad project focuses on artistic researches and projects in the same frequency and 
                        unpredictability. For accumulative production, more production drives more input. 
                        Therefore, the project is an attempt to build a network architecture, which enables jumps 
                        from one node to another by gathering content from diverse sources through artistic 
                        research and practice. To grasp and compare different realities of diverse locations, cases, 
                        positions and situations would enrich this project. It will be an accumulative process, which 
                        concentrates on strong content and criticality in the research-based art works, conveyed 
                        through the use of advanced technologies.
                        
                        NEO nomad project site will develop content in time by documenting all editions of the 
                        exhibitions, screenings, activities, presentations, concepts, and the development of the 
                        entire project.
